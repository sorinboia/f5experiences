Intro to the workshop

This workshop will provide guidelines on how to deploy an application from scratch in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service environment while protecting and enhancing the application availability and usability with Nginx solutions.

For this workshop we are going to use the "Arcadia Crypto" application.
